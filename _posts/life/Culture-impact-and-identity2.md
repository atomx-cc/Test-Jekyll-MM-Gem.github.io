# Talk with Cynthia

Date: September 1, 2024

**Cynthia:** 

Where I was is the biggest Chinese teahouse in Europe. Right in the middle of the Upper Rhine Basin, near Mannheim. I simply love the atmosphere there.

I want to visit China, but I am a bit afraid to travel alone.

That is something I feel is missing from European culture. We come from mostly farmers, so there was no real chance to develop such a rich and deep culture. Sure we have our unique history, music and identity, but a lot was lost during christianisation as well. Unified writing systems with only a few countries having unique ones. Philosophy only really developped in the 16th century etc.

**Atom:**
A real situation, the vast majority of Chinese, especially the powerful class(government leaders and rich people), choose to immigrate to developed countries in Europe and North America, including neighboring Japan or Singapore. China is just a world sweatshop, a place suitable for making money, and it is not suitable for human survival and development because of the political system. Each country has its own unique culture. Of course, in terms of comparative advantages, Europe and North America are still the most developed countries and regions in the world. From the number of visa-free countries on your passport, you can see that you were born with a golden key, but I have to work hard enough and spend ten years to get a temporary visa to Europe, and I am …

People always lack cultural confidence and think that other people's lives are better than our own, so people always envy each other. After you have a deep understanding of the lower class society and the lives of ordinary people in a country, you can make a comprehensive comparative conclusion. How much do you like that place? If the full score is 100, I can only give China 30 points, Germany can give 60 points, and Europe can only be considered barely passing. There are many drawbacks and problems. In our lifetime, we can see that Europe and North America will go downhill and become worse and worse. At that time, many native Europeans may find it unbearable, forcing them to immigrate to other places, possibly to Novosibirsk or Mars.

**Cynthia:** 

I mean I was purely basing my point on cultural history, so I agree with everything you say.

And yes, I am aware of the birth priviledge I have and I need to keep it in front of me. And I definitely agree with your point of seeing Europe and North America decline. I mean we can observe it already with the rise of the far right parties all over the place. I really hope it will settle down again in the nearest future. Especially here in Germany, I question the sanity of a lot of the people voting for the new nazi party. Did they really learn nothing from 80 years ago? "We are being ignored by the gouvernment and the foreigners get everything." That is there sentiment. I mean sure, I understand the dissatisfaction. What I don't understand is the blatand racism.
And also the complete anti-LGBTQ+ retoric. We just want to live our lives and find ourselfs in the crossfire. It is just pointless.

**Atom:** 

Many East Asians believe that Europe represents the lifestyle of the aristocracy, which is the highest civilization and culture in the world. However, after Europeans and Americans travel to China and Africa or watch short videos on TickTok, they suddenly lose confidence in their own cultural history. Europeans and Americans think that the history and culture of Africa and China are richer. There is also a fact that China's history is only more than 100 years old. China is a political concept. Through the violence of communism, dozens of countries with independent culture and history were forcibly unified to form the so-called unified China today. You are attracted to a certain local culture, such as Sichuan, Guangdong, Fujian, Yunnan, Tibet, Mongolia, etc. There is no broad and general concept of Chinese culture in the world. If many world-class scholars want to study authentic Chinese local culture, they will go to Taiwan, Japan, and even Southeast Asia, because after more than 100 years of revolution and turmoil, authentic Chinese culture has been destroyed and there is little left, but many authentic Chinese local cultures have been preserved in other countries.

**Cynthia:** 

I see. Thank you for explaining, I am only broadly aware of the East Asian history. We did it in history and I had one auxillary course in East Asian philosophy in high school. So, yes I am aware of the turmoil over the centuries, but I thought that there had been an effort to keep more of a cultural identity. And yes, as China is really big, the different regions have other culture. Life is there to learn and I am here to be corrected by people who understand more. And I tend to stay away from social media, because it is really bad for my mental health.

**Atom:**

I love such interesting conversations. It is a pity that we did not have such in-depth discussions when we lived together before. I decided to respond to you by writing a few blog posts. Your views represent the views of many young Europeans, which is also something that confuses me. Many people in the outside world do not understand what is really happening in Europe. The mainstream news media is also unable to report responsibly and objectively. As a digital nomad or remote worker, I can choose to escape to any place to live my own peaceful life, of course, I have a greater responsibility to brave some certain complex situations.

**Cynthia:**

I have the point of view of the "young" adult that is politically left. A lot of us are fed up with the hyper-capitalistic way of life, but are also painfully aware that to far left is also exploitative in nature. And the thing is, society splits itself in two. One the one hand, we have the more and more liberal people who welcome diversity and are eager to learn, but on the other hand we have the radicalized people, especially the old generation, but more frightingly the youngest voters as well. I personally don't exactly know why, if it is really the dissatisfaction, or them just trying to be "cool" and rebelling against the system.

# Why do Chinese people like to rush to pay?

Atom: This is a very common phenomenon. Compared with people in Europe and other regions, Chinese people like to show that they are more successful, richer, and more responsible. It may also be to show that they like or respect each other.
In particular, Chinese men must show that they are more willing to pay, which means a strong and dominant social status and identity symbol.
Even the weak or poor men try to be generous in spending small amounts of money, but at many critical moments, they will appear very stingy, timid and cowardly.
Growing up in such a cultural background, it is inevitable to carry this inertia. If Western friends show a firm attitude of "paying by themselves", then the Chinese will probably stop.
Indeed, sometimes Western friends feel unhappy or disrespected on this issue.
Because many Chinese have unspeakable plots and motives behind paying, such as obtaining illegal business interests, corrupt power transactions in politics, and especially rushing to pay for young women, which means that men are seeking sexual transactions.

**Cynthia:** 

So, in Luxembourg (I don't know how it is here in Germany), if I say "I will pay" that means, I want to pay something forward without any stings attached. Meaning, to refuse basically means "I refuse your gesture of friendship" and it is considered kind of rude.
I understand your point, so I am not offended.

Yeah, I get that. In Western countries it is really a thing of, either showing appretiation if you buy someone a drink or like "setteling a debt" so for example, if you pay for something, it is normal that the time afterwards I would pay both taps, or in a bar you would say "this round is on me".

# 为什么中国人喜欢抢着付钱？

Atom: 这是个很普遍的现象，相对于欧洲和其他地区的人而言，中国人喜欢表现自己更成功，更有钱，更负责任，也可能是为了表明喜欢或尊重对方。
尤其是中国男人必须表现得更愿意付款，这意味着一种强势和统治性的社会地位和身份象征。
即使弱势者或贫穷的男人，也尽可能在花钱很小的方面表现得很慷慨，但是在很多关键时刻，他们会显得非常吝啬、胆小和怯懦。
在这样的文化背景下生长，所以不可避免带着这种惯性，如果西方朋友表现得很坚决的态度“自己付钱”，然后中国人大概会收手。
确实有时候在这个问题上，西方朋友感到不愉快或没有得到尊重。
因为很多中国人在付钱背后，有着不可明说的图谋和动机，例如为了获取不法商业利益，在政治上的腐败的权力交易，尤其抢着为年轻女性买单，意味着男人图谋性交易。

Cynthia: 

因此，在卢森堡（我不知道德国的情况如何），如果我说“我会付钱”，这意味着我想付出一些，但不想有任何附加条件。意思是，拒绝基本上意味着“我拒绝你的友好姿态”，这被认为是一种粗鲁的行为。
我理解你的意思，所以我没有生气。

在西方国家，这确实是一种行为，如果你请别人喝一杯，要么表示感谢，要么“还债”，例如，如果你付了钱，那么之后我会付两次酒钱，或者在酒吧里你会说“这一轮我请客”。
