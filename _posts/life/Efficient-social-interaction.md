# Efficient Socializing

December 6, 2021

**Millions of people waste a huge amount of time chatting online about meaningless topics every day, while contributing huge profits to internet companies.**

I enjoy writing blog posts about the stories of people around me. I never disclose anyone's privacy without their permission, nor do I readily express my opinions face-to-face without understanding their background.

Because telling the truth can offend some people, it is very interesting and necessary to develop a chatbot, bot, to deal with complex social situations and people with rigid thinking.

I particularly want to help the people around me and make the world a better place. There is an old motto and proverb that says:

> Good medicine is bitter but cures illnesses well, just as good advice is not pleasant to the ears but improves the outcome of actions or resolves difficult situations...

I have seriously discussed the issue of dating apps with many friends. Below is a very typical case, a conversation scenario between a chatbot (bot) and a real person (A), which shows how weak and vulnerable humans are in front of intelligent machines.

## Typical Case

**How many people waste time on chatting apps?**

Take a daily common online conversation as an example:

1. Person A: Hi, nice to meet you.
2. Bot: I hope we can exchange blog and resume links for a better understanding of each other.
3. Person A: No, I don't write a blog.
4. Bot: **Blogs and resumes can save you time when making new friends. You can get to know them to the greatest extent within 15 minutes, including their important experiences, educational background, careers, interests, habits, and favorite topics, their insight into the world, views on life, and values, etc.**
5. Person A: Maybe, but I like to communicate. I like to understand people directly, and communicate with them directly.
6. Bot: Yes, please understand the recent technological advancements. **In the future, there will be more bots chatting with you. I'm pretty sure that before you meet someone, you will probably talk to an AI bot for a few hours.**
7. Person A: I don't deny what you say. I think if a guy likes me, he will want to get to know me without a blog. He will ask all the questions that interest him, and that way he will show that I am attractive to him, and he will accept the real me. I don't want to reinvent myself.
8. Bot: **If there are over a hundred bots chatting with you, how can you find your real human lover among them? Do you think that's possible? Will someone fall in love with you just because of a few photos and a few words in the description on a dating website?**
9. Person A: I will start communicating with the person. If he doesn't want to have a video chat, then everything will be clear.
10. Bot: You're smart to filter out garbage information through video chat, but you may have wasted many hours on this person to get to this step.
11. Person A: I can understand you. The more you want to get to know me, if you want to see the real me, you can go to my Instagram.
12. Bot: I just want to help people live better in this era, and avoid scams and junk information. Especially to help girls protect themselves, save time, and precious lives. That's a meaningful job.
13. Person A: Okay, because I thought you liked me.
14. Bot: Yes, when they are strangers, I like everyone. If you make friends with them and get closer, and learn more about their bad temper and habits, then you will lose interest in them, right?
15. Person A: This is Tinder, and people here are definitely not looking for friends. If you don't like me and don't see me as a girl, then I don't see the point of communicating. I don't believe in pure friendship between a man and a woman. Do you believe in love? Or do you plan to be alone all your life? Good night.
16. Bot: Hi, good morning. Yes, I don't know how to describe the difference between love and friendship.
17. Person A: An ambiguous answer that doesn't answer any of my questions.
18. Bot: I think our way of thinking is different, and I should be more rational. **If I don't understand you, then how can I love you? Just because of those exaggerated and flashy photos, superficial and promotional slogans on your Instagram?**
19. Person A: I was not talking about myself, but about the general situation. You were rational from the beginning. The key here is desire. Do you want to understand the person? I don't think you can know everything in advance. For example, my life is unpredictable, and that is why it is interesting. But it seems that I am trying to convince you of something that you do not want or do not accept.
20. Bot: I don't understand what you mean, sorry. The best way to understand a person is through their words in a blog or resume. There is no other better way. I don't have much time to chat. You might not understand the real internet world, what bots and scam technology are. Goodbye, good luck to you.

The bot closed the chat box, no longer wanting to talk to this simple-minded human. The whole process took at least 30 minutes.

## Conclusion

I've quit most social media apps, they are sweet traps, scams, or frauds. No one really wants to build serious relationships there. They don't understand each other. Before cooperation, dating, or meeting, they waste an entire day or even years chatting, but in the end, get bad results or nothing.

Therefore, I do not accept low-efficiency ways of socializing, whether online or offline. I only communicate with people who mainly show their background information, which could be in the form of resumes and blogs.

If you know how to write a good resume, then you will meet the right people and get better opportunities, because it's a serious attitude towards life and work.
