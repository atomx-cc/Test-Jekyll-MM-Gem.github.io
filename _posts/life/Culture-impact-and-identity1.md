Talk with Mat

人类和一切生物都是上帝的伟大创造，我的家庭医生说，当她在解剖实验台上观察人的大脑时，她感觉很恶心，但是又觉得很神奇，人为何有那么多奇特和复杂的情绪和想法，来自于这一坨像豆腐的大脑？

Human beings and other all biology are great creatures by God. My family doctor said that when she observed the human brain on the anatomy laboratory table, she felt disgusted, but also found it amazing. Why do humans have so many strange and complex features, Emotions and thoughts that come from this tofu-like brain?

我不理解 LGBT 或吸烟行为，但我在其中发现了一些友善的人。 祝他们健康、好运。 当然我也有些担心他们，吸烟似乎很危险，因为我接触香烟、酒精或太多工业食品时很容易生病。于我而言，这些生活方式都是极其不健康的。
我不可能成为钢铁侠飞到火星，因为我对后现代的生活方式不适应，但是我特别希望成为钢铁侠。

对我们的肉身进行生物、化学、数字和机械改造，并最终成为转基因人类。香烟和化学品对于钢铁侠来说只是幼儿园水平。

I don't understand LGBT or smoking behaviour, but I have found some kind people among them. and just wish them healthy and good luck. of course I am some worried usually about them, it seem dangerous for smoking, because I get sick easily when I touch cigarette, alcohol, or too much industrialised food.

To me, these lifestyles are extremely unhealthy.
I know I couldn't become Iron man and fly to Mars in the future, because I am extremely unsatisfied with post-modern life-style. but I really want to become Iron man.

biological, chemical, digital and mechanical modification on our flesh body, and also finally a GMO human being.
cigarette and chemicals are just kindergarten level for Iron man.

当我还是个5岁左右的孩子的时候，父母和村民训练我吸烟，但是失败了，我周围所有人都认为我们必须吸烟，然后才能做大生意或成为伟大的政治领袖。
香烟是强壮的成功人士的标准配置的标志，很显然我天生不适合这样的强人社会。

那么寻找其他适合我的生存之道吧！

When I was a child around 5 years old, my parents and villagers trained me to smoke, I failed and everyone around me thought that we must smoke before we can do big business or become a great political leader.
Cigarettes are a standard symbol of strong, successful people, and it was obvious that I was not born to fit into such a strong-man society.

Then find other ways of survival that suit me.

为了追求自由，我来到欧洲，其实欧洲也有很多方面让我觉得很难受，好处是欧洲很包容，任何思想言论都在这里存在，我不奢望找到一个完美的生存环境。
当大多数人求同存异，和谐共处时，我就觉得很满足了。如果要赚很多钱，还是回中国吧，但钱不是我的主要人生动力来源。

In order to pursue freedom, I came to Europe. In fact, there are many aspects in Europe that make life difficult for me. The good thing is that Europe is very tolerant and all thoughts and speeches exist here. I don’t expect to find a perfect living environment.
I feel very satisfied when most people seek common ground while shelving differences and live in harmony. If I want to make a lot of money, I'd better go back to China, but money is not my main source of motivation in life.

*Tips:*

这是我写博客的方式，比较简单，只是收集一些日常生活对话。

*this is my way to write blog, easier, just collect some daily life dialogue.*
my current interest is about to build a social media to have more conversation with people in different culture background.
but now I have some problem in computer work, because I don't want to sit for too long time everyday on the chair.
