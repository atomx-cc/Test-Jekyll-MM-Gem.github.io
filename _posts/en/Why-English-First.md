# Ukrainian vs. Russian

**2021.6.14, Why did I use a language exchange app?**

I arrived in Kyiv Ukraine a month ago, I decided to stay here with temporary work for no more than 3 years by work visa and residence permission.

So I consider studying the local language, most parts of friends recommend Russian, it is more popular around the world. I think if we respect local people more, I should speak Ukrainian. but they think it’s doesn’t matter related to the National complex, only a few radical nationalists will angry when you speak Russian to them in Ukraine.

I don't know how to choose, Russian or Ukrainian? Those two kinds of language are very similar. I want to explore no more than 1 month to make the decision which one would prefer finally. Anyway, I started the self-taught Ukrainian online for phonetic symbols and alphabets.

**2021.7.1, 2 Weeks later, I can read and spell simple words.**

I was passively learning Russian or Ukrainian every day. I didn't deliberately study it, I was able to read out many roadside billboards and spell them out. If I stay in Ukraine or Russian longer, I'm pretty sure I can handle it very well for daily life.

 I still can not talk freely with local people and need some time to practice, then I decide to go to the language exchange app for help, a colleague suggests Tandem, This is the first time I use a language exchange app, let's try how is it going?

**‌I register a profile as follows:**

> My mother language is Chinese, I can speak English at the middle level and Japanese at the primary level. Seeking Ukrainian or Russian local speakers.
> 

**2021.7.15, Less than 1 month later, I changed my mind to Language study.**

I have been living in Kyiv for 1.5 months already, and know more about the current Ukrainian society. it's very similar to China mainland in many aspects as a developing country. 

I should move to West Europe or North America, so I don't have a plan to live in Ukraine for the long term.

I explain "**Immigration to a better place**" in another article, please search the updates in my blog.

Then local language is not necessary for me right now. 

So let's study English during the current stage, and I will pass IELTS band scores 7, after that, I can take Ukrainian for the next target.

My profile in the language exchange community is changed as follows:

> My passion and hobbies: IT, Computer science, remote work, geek. 
People I would like to talk with: Independent thinking, smart, open-minded, like to share. 
My goals: I hope to pass a serious exam IELTS with band scores of 7, be fluent in speaking, it's not social networking for dating here.
My topics: Environment, anthropology, cosmology, agri-food, politics, sports, health, etc.

# language exchange

2021.7.15, No more than 1 month later after I install this app, I want to quit Tandem, it's not appropriate for some causes.

1. **Low efficiency** 
when a language app's core function is designed as an instant messenger, but it's not a professional IM, the user experience is not so good, cause I study IT and make web apps.
if the development of tandem was based on other main study apps or instant messengers, for eg. Whatsapp, telegram, etc. I am pretty sure more people will be activated here. but Tandem may be afraid that Out of control in company ownership.

2. **Studying vs. dating**
Tandem is similar to a social network app, many people just want to seek out friends there. I am sure it is not a professional tool for language learners. There are at least 10 people saying hello to me when I log in Tandem community first time. but most part of them just say hello and appear once in a lifetime. 

There is a girl who writes in her profile of Tandem. 

> I am happily married, so please, do not write or follow me if you want something different from learning a language together :)
> 

Tandem is in an Embarrassing Situation, neither language study nor dating app. their OKR should be How to activate people talk more. it's not Tandem's fault, it's mine, yeah, how to talk more. 

I suggest language partners shifting to other professional instant messengers, then I know it's not good for the language community, I'm wrong, I must follow the rules of the app. 

Obviously, if I want to practice English, I should find a native English speaker, but not a native Korean speaker. it seems not so many native English speakers have an interest in my mother language Chinese currently, maybe, China is closed its gate in recent years, many westerners find that it's harder for their survival and left gradually. 

**More professional apps** 

I recommend serious language learning, it's worth paying.

# **Why promote Japanese?**

‌As I have mentioned before, most part of people can not keep practising. 

Except a Russian student Sofya keep speaking with me in English, the only one who could speak for over 2 weeks, although both of ours' English is not so good. ‌

When I was hesitating and dilemma about which language would prefer. my language exchange partner is almost in the same situation. 

Sofya wants to study Korean and has an interest in East Asia. After a short talk, She decides to think about it for 2 months, which one will be preferred.

I know more about East Asia, mainly including Japan, Korea, and China. **if anybody has an interest in East Asia, I will definitely suggest Japan.** 

**Japan’s culture:**

the most typical tradition and authentic cultural characteristics. it’s a new and old country with a long history.

Many people love to study Japanese, because of the famous Japanese animation movie and delicious food. I love all figures in Hayao Miyazaki' animation movie

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki)

‌

there are many pirated video copies in developing countries, they are poor and could not afford the Genuine version. there is a trial:

[https://thesmartlocal.com/japan/japanese-anime-movies/](https://thesmartlocal.com/japan/japanese-anime-movies/)

Frankly speaking, only Japanese animation movies could make me cry, I never cried before as a man. Japanese special culture deeply impacts me since I was a child.

‌

**Japan’s progress:**

- Japan is more open, they study from the whole world. but China is too Conservative and old only old, not new;
- Japan is modern and advanced in science & technology, the most powerful and developed country in Asia;
- Japan could be one of the top 10 countries in the world;
- Japan is the only country list on G7 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Seven);
- Japan is the first Asian country listed in OECD;

Japan has little motherland on their island, so Japanese people immigrate to the whole world, Japanese passport is free visa to over 130 countries, really high-value passport. So it's not easy for too many people to immigrate to Japan, but you are welcome to travel and study over there.

# Next-generation will be better

Let's come back to talk about English.

Ukraine is closed to Europe and England, I thought at least most part of people could speak English before I came here, but in fact, It’s not.

I have been living in Kyiv for over 3 months already, I meet at least 100 local people, but no more than 10 could speak English, they are adults, have daily jobs and meet foreigners usually,  indeed, Kyiv is an international capital city.

It's trouble sometimes to talk with local people, thanks to the great IT dynasty, we can solve the problem by smartphone.

I usually go to a restaurant near my hotel, I ask a guy who works there "can I speak English?", he just smile and say"No English",  He could only speak "Hi, Yes, No" and smile to me every day. it's said that many people's salary is no more than 500 USD per month, even the professor of the university.

European Union is visa-free to Ukrainian, if they want, it's very easy to go the west.

Then I translate to Russian to him and ask "If you know English, you can work in European Union, your salary will be at least 5 times higher than here", he replies "I never think about it, my home is here, I don't know English". 

But somebody told me that, they are lazy to study and work.

I hope local people could speak English more, If they study more from developed countries, they could be stronger. 

Any kind of another language from North and West Europe is good for them, such as the nearest German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Danish etc. all of them belong to the same Indo-European language family which has the three largest phyla are Romance, Germanic, and Slavic, they are very closed similar language to each other in my opinion, it's easier for East European people to learn. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe)

I recognize that my oral speaking ability is decreased in the past 3 months in Ukraine, even worse than in China, maybe most part of people's pronunciation is worse than mine, that's why I want to search for a language exchange partner in apps. 

**Kid is perfect**

Except for a little girl who could speak very perfect English pronunciation, I met her in my living hotel early morning, when I was cooking in the public kitchen, she spoke to me, asked many questions.

Then I know she was no more than 10 years old in age, her mom was sleeping, so she had to eat breakfast alone.  After the meal, she cleaned the table, but it's not easy with her height is just the same as the dining table.

I know more about her story that she got sick, was brought to see doctor in Kyiv by her mom, but her father was working in another city. Her vocabulary was very limited to explain her living city  Zaporizhzhia Запоріжжя, she doesn't know how to speak in English that I searched out the map with a translator on the smart phone.

Then next morning, she said goodbye to me and went back. 

I hope the kid will be healthy and can study abroad, I will provide financial support if we can meet again. 

 

# Why English first?

**It should be explained WHY in few words**

1. First of all, English is the most popular language in the world, you can travel, work and live anywhere in English.
2. The top 20 developed countries and most parts of OECD countries accept English as their first or second language. 
3. The most important science and technology inventions, the best university and high quality of educational resources, are all written in English firstly.
4. The English speaking nations create the past 3 hundred years of history with the most brilliant culture and civilization, they are also the founder of the most powerful countries on earth.
5. the easiest way of Immigration is by work visa and study visa, the first requirement is English level, the most important factor for you start a new life in a new place.

 

**More developed more English**

**the countries are more developed if there is a higher rate of English speakers in Europe**. comparatively, the Russian language areas are undeveloped in eastern Europe which used to be controlled by communism. take the data statistic graph for reference.

[https://languageknowledge.eu/languages/english#google_vignette](https://languageknowledge.eu/languages/english#google_vignette)

English is preferred to be the top skill achievement, the easiest way to success, nothing else will help us most in this world. if you handle English well, you can get anything you want.

[https://www.british-study.com/en/importance-of-english-language/](https://www.british-study.com/en/importance-of-english-language/)

Any kinds of certificates are good, if you can get them, it's helpful for your immigration and study abroad.

I will only focus on English, not other languages with no time to waste. 

I have a very clear key goal of language training, get a certificate of English level.

I would rather pass the IELTS exam with a band score of 7. I collect many study courses and materials already.

If you have the same idea, please ask me for help.

**how to study English from a basic level?**

In my experience, the best way to upgrade English skills. 

first of all, is pronunciation, then you are fluently and smoothly in listening and speaking, your brain has quick memory and big storage, of course, it could work better to process complicated phrases, so you don't need to care about vocabulary and grammar. our brain is similar to a computer CPU.

then it's about reading and writing. so the above 4 skills constructed the IELTS's core technology.

please search my other blog for your reference in detail, **IELTS training**, for How to study English?

**How to acquire any language NOT learn it!**

[https://youtu.be/illApgaLgGA](https://youtu.be/illApgaLgGA)

acquire language likes babies, don't think it by the brain, just listening and speaking. take baby's pictures book, storytelling for primary level conversation practice. don't use another language for the explanation, only focus on the target language.

## Efficient way

I found the language exchange club and app both online and offline are not good in condition, my words to language exchange partner are below:

Hi Guys, we are always busy with daily lives and work, so the offline meeting and conversations are not easy for many people. So I suggest a smart way - Blogging.

Why blogging?

1. For efficient socializing: better understanding each other within 15 minutes, filter the people and topics you like or dislike in advance, save your precious time and life energy.
2. For English learning: practice writing in the most difficult part of the IELTS exam, prepare topics before a high-quality conversation.

Don't answer people stupid questions repeatedly every day, right? tell them: please watch my blog and resume, it answers better, do you have any other good questions?
