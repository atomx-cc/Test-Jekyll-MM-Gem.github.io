As the reason you all known, I came to Europe as a backpacker for sometimes.


**March 2023- Europe**

I traveled through numerous towns, meet people with diversity ethnics and backgrounds. After upheaval and displacement… later I worked in an E-commerce company in big city, handling online orders and warehouse for thousands of offline stores and Amazon.

**Current Mindset:** 
I live peacefully, and I don’t lack material things, but I feel a strong sense of crisis and anxiety  usually, especially since great pandemic. Someday circumstances might force us to change lifestyle, we have to move far away from big cities and modern civilization.

**Getting Prepared:** 
To be ready for unexpected events, I believe we should learn basic self-sufficiency skills. These skills, rooted in essential knowledge, can help us navigate challenging times.

**Lifestyle:** 
I find contentment as an “IT farmer,” living in a picturesque and prosperous small town. My days strike a harmonious balance between physical and mental work — code with left hand and farm with right.

**Daily Routines:** 
Half of my time is dedicated to an online computer programming boot-camp. The other half involves part-time work alongside farm owners and landlords. 

I engage in diverse tasks: herding horses and sheep, beekeeping, house repairs, gardening, growing fruits and vegetables, and caring for children.

**Entrepreneurial Vision:** 
Calling all like-minded partners! If you resonate with this lifestyle, I have wonderful commitments for the future. Let’s explore various locations across continents on earth. 

Together, we’ll establish horticultural farms, share workspaces, engage in remote work, contribute to community service, and champion open-source initiatives.
