### Favourite movies?

Many favorites, eg. Forrest Gump, 3 idiots. but I donâ€™t watch movies usually.

The most favourites are environmental documentary films, eg. BBC series, Blue Planet, etc.

I changed my job to the Agriculture industry since I was deeply impacted by these films with high scores reviews that changed my worldview, help me rethinking the sci-tech, modern life, and the power of industry.
