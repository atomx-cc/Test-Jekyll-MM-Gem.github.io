# Interview list of NGO

Date: November 3, 2019

I used to apply for the environment project of NGO in China, they send an interview list with good questions, such as:


# 你是从哪里得知这个项目机会的？

我有收藏很多与环境，动物，植物产品相关的新闻源。

# 为什么对这个项目感兴趣？

过去10年从事的都是农业，食品电商工作，一直都有深入探索食物背后的环境，动物，健康等相关议题，非常熟悉这些话语体系，各种公开课也上了不少。

# 迄今为止，人生中最骄傲的成就是什么？

懂点IT技术，会造梯子翻墙，视野开阔，提升认知，信息自由则精神思想丰裕，对社会和人生有独立思考和深度洞察，有信仰并持续行动（虽然几乎都被现实环境挫败）

# 请分享一下你通常是如何从早到晚度过一天的。

I spent much time in a farmyard of China Hangzhou suburb since 3 years ago, very regular lives by bio-clock.

**Good morning**

6:30 - 7:00 am

I wake up naturally and then go to the bathroom on time every day, no exception holiday.

Usually, I talk to myself, thank GOD, I am still alive, can hear birds twitter, watch green land and feel warm about SUN, I have more luck than most other people and animals.

**Work and study**

7:00am - 9:00pm

Power on my laptop and start a new day work, and talk to co-workers till afternoon, then study new MOOCs after super.

I stand up from my chair once every hour and deal with housework, telephone and go to bathroom etc. sometimes I may stand up once for 2 hours for the emergency task.

**2.5 meals a day**

9:00- 10:00 am, brunch, fresh food cooked totally by myself once a day ;

2:00- 2:30 pm, tea break, snacks and cookies fast food, no-cook and fire;

5:30- 6:30 pm,  supper, just heat the left food of brunch, easy and fast;

**Good night**

10:30 pm

I end up a day by kindle or radio of any kind story, I listen to bible story with my family recently.

Usually, fall to sleep no more than 15 minutes after lying down on the pillow, I always have good quality sleep.

**Besides**

I will go for 1-hour outdoor activity each day after supper or tea break usually, while the weather is good ;

Watching an online movie once every weekend after supper ;

Anticipating online church weekend worship every Sunday morning at 10:00- 11:30 am;

# 你想拥有一份什么样的工作？5年之后有可能实现吗？

不受时间和空间限制的远程工作，不需要每天在市区乘车上下班，最近1年已经实现了，但是效果还不太好，因大多数服务的公司单位都习惯面对面沟通协作，不免需要跑实地，全民普及线上协作的习惯还有待时日。

# 在理想情况下，你希望每周工作几小时？

我现在的工作学习的节奏超过60小时/周，可接受每周只休息一天。如果少于60小时，那就谢天谢地了！

# 你对该职位的最低工资要求是多少？

只要是喜欢的事情，在初期能保证生存就可以，例如中国一线城市（北上广地区）人均每个月需要5000-7000rmb就够。

# 假设你的人生目标是在未来5年内赚尽可能多的钱，请写2-3段文字说明你会采用的赚钱方式及其成功的几率。

Frankly speaking, I don’t think we can get money from an ideal job, such as non-profits projects, environment and animal welfare etc. I have been working for many years as a volunteer in China mainland, lots of friends even have serious survival problems if they only have non- profits’ jobs.

So, I develop many IT skills that can get a good income in the current HR market from other businesses, but not non-profits’ sectors, I always try to find a good solution but haven’t found it yet.

Let’s take a deep insight through the whole imperfect industry chain, there are huge niche markets and opportunities over there. From the Upstream, Agriculture land of raw material,  Manufactures for deep processing; Middle stream, Packaging, warehousing and logistics; to Downstream, E-commerce, marketing, media etc., every section need us to do IT, computing and more efficient network service, that’s what I good at.

To get more people business together is the key point of success, we need the so-called traditional Chinese GUANXI (关系 relationship) is very complicated, it always makes me bored and hard, many young people are not good at it either, but somebody is very good at establishing new Guanxi(business rules), not the traditional old one.

We can cooperate to solve it and get good profits together.
