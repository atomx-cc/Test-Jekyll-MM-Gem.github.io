## 36 Interpretation:

Many YouTuber claim that Mormons do not believe in the Trinity and are not Christians, which is slander. Therefore, the best way to explore a doctrine is to read the original texts.

## **37** Interpretation:

Using computer programming as an analogy, God designed the programming language and tools with great tolerance, allowing us to repeatedly modify and improve our flawed code until we perfect the program and produce the correct result.

Most children make mistakes because they are innocent and do not lie. They admit their mistakes honestly, and as long as they can improve, they are good children. If a child under 10 years old is naturally inclined to lie and cover up mistakes, I have seen such cases. Unfortunately, they must have been born into a family and society filled with demonic attributes, making improvement very difficult, but they still have a chance.

This means that we can repent when we make mistakes. The key is repentance, and only then can we obtain the pass to the kingdom of God and ultimately reach our destination.

As for why water baptism is used, it is a mysterious ritual that I do not yet understand, just as I cannot understand why women always need flowers to accentuate their beauty.

I asked a pastor why not use bungee jumping to declare joining the family of Christ? When you overcome fear and trust a rope called “Jesus,” then leap off the cliff, you are a true believer; otherwise, you still doubt God. Or baptize in an icy river at minus 10 degrees in winter. That unique feeling and extreme state might trigger a WiFi connection with the God.

We know that people in near-death states need electric shocks to restart the blood flow in their hearts. Many people’s repentance comes through extreme states, such as experiencing the death of loved ones, economic crises, wars, major illnesses, etc.

A person who lives a peaceful life is like a flower in a greenhouse. Although very happy, they also have some shortcomings. They may not experience the ravages of storms.

Therefore, I can fully understand suffering. Suffering is not necessarily a bad thing, and peace is not necessarily a good thing. We are always struggling and spiraling upwards on the path of suffering, ultimately reaching the heavenly kingdom in the clouds.


# New vocabularies

**Covenant** 

In the Book of Mormon, the word "covenant" is often used to signify a **commitment or promise**. A covenant is a **sacred agreement or contract**, particularly between God and His followers. 

It carries a sense of mutual **obligation and dedication**. In religious texts, covenants are central to the relationship between God and believers, highlighting **trust and loyalty**.

**sacrament**

The term sacrament refers to a religious ceremony or act that is considered an outward and visible sign of inward and spiritual divine grace. In Christianity, sacraments are rites believed to have been instituted by Jesus and are observed as a means of receiving grace. Common examples include baptism and the Eucharist (also known as Holy Communion). These rituals hold profound spiritual significance and symbolize important aspects of the faith.
