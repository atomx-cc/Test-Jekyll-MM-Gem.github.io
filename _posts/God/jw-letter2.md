**Hello brothers and sisters,**

We have been communicating for a few months now, and I hope that these conversations will improve my understanding of the vast system of JW, which may not be clear due to the language and cultural differences between us. So I prefer to communicate in documents (letters).

I am a pragmatic utilitarian, and I don't want to say things easily if I don't have real actions and results, and most of the time "helping others" may be an empty slogan. I think I should help myself to change my situation first, so that I can grow stronger, and then I can help others. I also don't like to keep learning all the time, and I prefer action to words.

For example, my job is unchallenging, and I am bored by the silly nonsense and falsehoods from the typical Chinese businessmen around me, and the JW brothers and sisters often say about "helping others"，How can you help me in this situation?

# Hostel

I currently live in a hostel downstairs from my office in the same building. it saves me from commuting to work, avoids traffic jams, and gives me plenty of time to run and exercise regularly and read non-business related documents.

I really liked the hostel, it was like living in a school dormitory, talking with many young people from different countries and regions, and I felt like I was always young at heart.

But be prepared for all the strange people you will meet there and how to deal and get along with them?

## Alarm Clock

There is a guy next door who goes to bed every morning at 1-2:00 a.m. His alarm clock starts at 6:00 a.m. and rings loudly every 10 minutes, and he presses it every time to stop the alarm clock and then goes back to sleep, so he presses it at least 10 times and then finally gets up reluctantly at about 7:30-8:00 a.m. How can he sleep well for almost 2 hours? also doesn’t consider disturbing other people's rest?

He probably wanted to get up early but lacked the perseverance and the alarm clock helped train the coward, I can't understand this behaviour, it's a mental illness.

Normal human behaviour is to get up as soon as you hear the alarm clock go off, or to turn it off completely and take a good nap so that your body and mind can rest in complete relaxation. We can forgive ourselves for occasionally being lazy and not getting up, which is normal, but continuously setting an alarm clock and being lazy is a mental illness.

## No talking

The hostel's kitchen and public area are social places, always full of young people’s fun, but there are people who don't fit in with this small community. There was a girl in another room who was never seen smiling or talking to anyone else, always with her head slightly down, face expression serious and eyes focused, and twice when we passed her to say hello, she didn't look up or say anything. I asked the others what’s wrong, no one could tell me what was going on with her, and in any case, don't bother her.

If you go to the toilet in the middle night, with the dark lights on the roof, and the smell of the bathroom damp and musty, you will feel creepy when you meet her in the empty corridor, because it is easy to associate with those girls in horror movies who were murdered unjustly, the image is too similar, but I almost do not have nightmares.

I wonder what the neighbours are like? Will something unpredictable suddenly happen? It's a certain hidden worry about something unknown.

## Discrimination

A local Ukrainian guy seemed unfriendly, always publicly humiliating and threatening several outsiders, including an Israeli and a couple of Turks, and if the outsiders hadn't been low and humble and a little more assertive, there might have been a fight.

The accusation was nothing more than that they had made the public facilities dirty and so on. It is indeed true that they might not have cooked or taken care of the household regularly at home before, and when they used the kitchen and toilet, they would always leave some problematic handles, such as putting too much water for washing dishes, not wiping the table clean, burning the frying pan black, making a mess on the stove, and so on. How to live under the same roof with other people? This is a common problem. How many people have received such training exercises before entering society?

They are discriminated and ostracized, I can do some relationship balancing and adjustment in the middle, and live with me for a small period of time, hopefully, to reduce similar problems, few people can easily pick on the work I do, because I live in school before the age of 10 years old live independently and self-care, know how to deal with all kinds of complex and tricky people.

## Management

The owner of the hotel is a well-built middle-aged lady, she may like beautiful things, the whole hotel decoration style looks pretty, but she ignored the functional design and personnel management, so the hotel is beautiful, but not comfortable and convenient to live in, she has to spend a lot of time and manual labour every day to do cleaning and maintenance.

I do product prototyping and standard system management, and I do everything about **QUALITY (Safety, Efficiency, Health, Comfort, Eco-kindness)**, I am confident that I can design **cleaner, lower cost, and better user experience** hotels, and if she is willing to take my suggestions for improvement, I am more than happy to collaborate and serve for free.

I told this idea and several people living in this hotel, they acted disdainful, as if they had nothing to do with it, and a girl said frankly that she absolutely does not believe that the hostess will improve the environment here, they do not want to save time and reduce the intensity of physical labour, most people's thinking model is a rigid or stereotype, they will only operate according to the established model of mainstream society for life, no one wants to live a long term here, everyone is a passenger, stay for a while and then leave, unnecessary to suggest any improvements and so on.

It's a shame to hear such feedback, most people have no confidence in the improvement of their own living environment.

> Food, clothing, housing, transportation, medical care and education are human basic needs. Accommodation is one of the needs. Everyone survive on it. A good living environment can cultivate kind, beautiful and more creative people.
> 

So I want to solve my own accommodation problem first, If we can't find a suitable hostel, I hope to find a few partners to cooperate in renting a large house, and work out the functional layout together, design the space to meet the various themes of Bible, develop the standard management of a chain of hostels, a sample of high-quality accommodation space, gradually replicate and expand the scale in different areas, recruit more staff to work, receive more guest to stay, all the people are trained and served according to the standards taught by God, provide better products and services to the society, and we might make big money, what's wrong with that?

Even if this quest for a standard accommodation space fails, it doesn't matter, at least I solved the accommodation problem for myself and a few friends around me, and this accommodation fee is not less or can't be saved in any case.

## Online communities and tools

Because of the various experiences above, we see that society is full of people who cannot progress, incomprehensible and weird, probably due to psychological barriers. If they do not have the ability to get out of the situation on their own, and they do not meet the right people to help them, it is very likely that the person will be scrapped, which is very unfortunate.

Most professions in the business world are focused on making money firstly, so as a patient, you may feel that doctors have cold faces, they work like machines, and the results of treatment can be hard to say. It's okay if you meet a doctor with technical and academic credentials, but what's worse is that the internet and the real world are full of fake doctors and medicine, and many patients are defrauded of their money and feelings hurts as a result, making the situation even worse.

> Health care and education are social infrastructures that should be better provided and free of charge, and not differentiated by poverty and wealth.
> 

If it is JW-trained counsellors and doctors, it will be completely different. They will be full of warmth and care for people and animals, and patients will be moved by positive emotions and recover completely from their autoimmunity to heal themselves. I fully believe that spiritual power can overcome most illnesses and pains, and non-commercial medical treatment works better.

And at the same time, our kind JW preachers, who are currently spreading God's word to all kinds of people in their lives through random means, but most part of the people will not listen, is this not a waste of the preacher's life? Preacher Lives Matter, Preachers' lives are also lives, and since all beings are equal, please, why should they make unnecessary sacrifices for those who are not likely to improve at all? This is irresponsible to the lives of preachers.

I support dedicating limited life and resources to those who really need it. To find out the netizens who have the need for consultation on various issues in the vast sea of people, there are methods.

1. developing applications for psychological counselling based on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, etc., and screening out among their huge number of users those who can clearly realize their problems and have a strong will to change.
2. automatically screened by chatbots according to problem categories first, then psychological and physiological experts for consultation, and finally introduced to the nearest distributed JW members to provide them with 1:1 counselling services assisted by a dedicated matchmaker, would this work well, right?

I have a few partners I can talk to, due to the professional relationship of IT technology development, most of them are introverted and not good at talking, we all feel that the world is chaotic and life is boring, full of power but no space to stretch their limbs. If we ignore their existence, it is a waste of talent. So, once again, I was restless and wanted to do something interesting.

A lot of good tools and data may be readily available and need to be recombined, optimized and enhanced, MVP minimum usable products and low-code development are becoming the trend, and technology development is not necessary to invest too much in **Reinventing the wheel** (I understand Artem's word).

With the help of the information age, we do any industry, if all adopt some organizational management methods of software developers, efficiency will multiply, mastering these skills will make each team member is worth millions, these keywords will make many people interested in.

> **open-source, distributed communities, remote work, OKR, geeks**
> 

Without the aid of fairly good technology, we cannot run faster than those who do evil (as the Bible says of the false prophets and the people of the city of Sodom), whose audience is large, expands extremely fast, and shows great allure.

## Immigration

I hope that the public environment can be improved, if I can not improve my living space, the only way left is to immigrate to more developed countries, after all, only in the top 20% countries of the world, the probability of civilized people will be higher, I have been in the visa process, which is sooner or later, I often advise friends to immigrate, it is the inevitable direction of personal life development.

When we enrich our own ability in the developed society, and then can come back to the poor society to create a career and sacrifice dedication, not yet, many of us are still in the young seedling stage, and so growing into a big tree can do great things, in order to shade the sky and resist the storm, We can't let ourselves die early when we are weak in the harsh survival environment, please live within our power and take what you can get.

I believe that.

> **People enter JW to study, they have a positive human attitude to pursue progress, they are not satisfied with the status quo, otherwise, what is the point of joining this organization?**
> 

These social systems are full of loopholes, and governments are not capable of management, and commercial companies are generally taking advantage of the loopholes to make profits.

> Criteria for a business: [Social enterprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_enterprise), which does not aim at profit first, but must create more competitive products and services.
> 

Most legitimate industries are doable, the key point is what kind of people are organized to work together? What kind of audience users are catered to? The same thing can be done in completely different directions, in line with or against God's faith.

But how many people have heard of JW, and I estimate that less than 1% of my friend's circle know about it in mainland China, so the organization is not well known enough to meet market demand. We are not running fast enough and need to accelerate!
