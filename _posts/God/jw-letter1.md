# Letter to JW group 1: A social business

Date: November 1, 2021

Social business can help most part of people, while commercial business lost function.

# Friends around

I have been living in Ukraine for 5 months already, and know some people around.

**Alis:** 25-year-old girl, majors in some computer programmes, know how to develop games and web apps, don't know how to find an appropriate job independently, still live at home with parents.

**Cathy:** 30-year-old boy, majors in graphic design, know how to draw pictures by Adobe suits. he loves cosmetics and clothes so much, but can not afford beautiful material life, fall into the honey trap of complicated relationship with many females by dating app.

**Lucy:** 35-year-old girl, a single mother with a girl of 2 years in age, majored in politics and jurisprudence, wish will go to complete her PhD in university again, but right now, she must wait until her girl is sent to kindergarten 3 years later.  

**Sasha:** 40-year-old boy, majored in business administration, wish to travel around the world, but should take care of his big family and many lovely dogs every day.

all of the above friends feel depressed, have no time, no dream or desire to the current world in reality. I know there are more people even in worse situations usually for the boring life and job.

I really want to tell them:

> for tackling the social problems.
Union our social relationship, Can we help each other!
Don't find a job, let's create opportunities for more people.
> 

# A business plan

Register an NGO providing social aid and consultation to people.

1. For single mothers: they can help to take care of others children, cooperate to run some kindergartens for more children; of course, they can live together in an apartment only for single mother union, support them to find a new husband and until they have a new family.
2. For elders: the same as above single mother's example, cooperate to run some welfare home for more elder people; different from children living with mother, all elder people can live together in an apartment only for the union members.
3. For professionals: both men and women, all young and elder people need better personal development, they will create a good view of the world, life and value by appropriate instruction with professionals of psychologist and entrepreneurs. 

# Social effects and impacts

**Saving time for young people:** children and elder people take up much time from young people, they should be liberty from the heavy housework and trivial family issues, then get more time for personal education and career development, of course, more time to enjoy life when they are not too old. 

**Better quality social service:** public welfare is always not good in developing countries, you should be rich and have lots of time at home, if you want to feed children and elders well in the family. so we need to upgrade the social service system, it's impossible to depend on government and commercial companies, especially, when you are born in a corruptive country. it's the only way to depend on social enterprise.

**Create jobs in unions:** government, school, religious organization, company, they can cooperate through NGO unions, more young people will work for the NGO unions and branches department, it's a meaningful job, be good for public welfare, not only for making money.

# **Rational thinking**

A brother makes correct decision.

He writes to his girlfriend:

After a day's consideration thoroughly, I think we are impossible to get married or to be in a close relationship because we are totally different.

My dear Alisha only asks for material life, never ask me other questions, her life quality is good and wants to have more, will not be satisfied easily. I pay more for sushi, flowers, and rings, but she just gains a little bit happier. so this behaviour is nonsense to me.

I would prefer to work for more poor people with less education and medical care, humanitarian touches my heart, given is love, I contribute to them less, but they gain more happiness,  their life will be improved a lot. so this deal will be more meaning full and worth doing.
