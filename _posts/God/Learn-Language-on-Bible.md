# Using the Bible to Learn a Foreign Language

Date: September 23, 2021

I knew grandma Lily when I went to see the dentist one day in Kyiv of Ukraine, she speak Chinese fluently with me and express her wish to practice Chinese language.

It's amazing, cause it is the first time I meet a stranger who could speak my mother language, then we add instant messenger of each other.

I participate in a chat group and know some very kind friends, they are a group who study the bible in Chinese online, they must be very smart people to realize four key goals in the meanwhile.

> **Studying Bible, Studying foreign language, helping others, helping themselves**
> 

they belong to a new Christianity organization, the website has over a thousand language versions

[https://www.jw.org/en/](https://www.jw.org/en/), it should be the most advanced web apps, shocked me again, even they have Fuzhou local dialects(福州方言) that are harder to study than Ukrainian for me.

# **How do I think of the religions?**

I know there are 3 main streams worldwide.

Christianity

Islam

Buddhism

Christianity, Judaism, Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Islamism are all originated from one God, they are one family, then separate into too many versions of divisions. Because I prefer Christianity, so here I would like to use Christianity as a symbol for other versions except for Islamism.

I have read almost the entire English version of the Bible and know many interesting and tragic stories;

Being born into a family with a Buddhist and Taoist atmosphere, I grew up reading a lot of Buddhist scriptures; 

In the next few years, I would like to read the Quran, make a few Muslim friends, if I have the chance, visit the Taliban caves, the villages and cities of Afghanistan.

This will allow me to understand the three dominant religions of the world and the spiritual thinking of most people, which will facilitate my travels around the world.


I believe the stories were true histories of human beings that were described in religious books, also with many fictional myths. 

But I still don't believe in miracle legend occurs yet, unless they can be proven to me, I am a scientific rationalist, and this is why I prefer Protestantism - Protestant Christianity. 

Many Chinese believe Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism are the 3 main streams in China, but it could not be worldwide. 

Because there were so many different versions, it was unclear which ones were the most important, and people from different sects argued about the importance of their scriptures.

Many people around me could not tell the difference between Taoist and Buddhist Gods. In the temples of rural areas, it was common to worship Gods of different sects together.

If Ukraine and Russia are open-minded countries? if there are other religions except for Orthodoxy?
